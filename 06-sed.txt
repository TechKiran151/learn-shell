sed is editor

Assume we have a file like this

chrony:x:992:989::/var/lib/chrony:/sbin/nologin
sshd:x:74:74:Privilege-separated SSH:/var/empty/sshd:/sbin/nologin
centos:x:1000:1000:Cloud User:/home/centos:/bin/bash
expense:x:1001:1001::/home/expense:/bin/bash

sed 's/nologin/yeslogin/' file
    s-> substitute

To modify the file, we use -i option to sed command,else it does only change in output

Assume we have a file like this
chrony:x:992:989::/var/lib/chrony:/sbin/nologin
sshd:x:74:74:Privilege-separated SSH:/var/empty/sshd:/sbin/nologin
centos:x:1000:1000:Cloud User:/home/centos:/bin/bash
expense:x:1001:1001::/home/expense:/bin/bash

Replace chrony with admin

sed 's/root/admin/' file
sed 's/root/admin/g' file
#g means global that entire line will be replace with admin

Delete lines can happen in two ways
1. line no
#d means delete
        sed '2d' file
 2. Search a word and delete those lines
        sed '/yeslogin/ d' file

Add your lines
#c means change
sed '1 c helo world' file
sed '/bash/ c Hellow World' file


sed -e '1d' -e '2 a Hello World' file

-e option is used to enable multiple operations with single sed command
